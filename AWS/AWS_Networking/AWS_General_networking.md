1. When is the route table in AWS Required?

In AWS, a route table is required whenever you need to define how network traffic is directed within a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC). Here are the primary scenarios where a route table is essential:

### Scenarios Requiring a Route Table

1. **Default Route Table for a VPC:**
   - Every VPC automatically comes with a main route table. This table controls the routing for all subnets that are not explicitly associated with any other route table.

2. **Custom Route Tables for Specific Subnets:**
   - When you create custom subnets within a VPC, you might want to control the routing of traffic for those subnets differently from the default behavior. In this case, you would create and associate custom route tables with those subnets.

3. **Public Subnets:**
   - A subnet that is intended to be public (i.e., accessible from the internet) requires a route table with a route directing internet-bound traffic to an Internet Gateway (IGW).

4. **Private Subnets:**
   - Private subnets, which are not directly accessible from the internet, still require a route table to handle internal VPC traffic and routing through a NAT Gateway or NAT Instance for outbound internet traffic.

5. **Connecting to Other VPCs (VPC Peering):**
   - When you connect multiple VPCs using VPC Peering, each VPC needs route table entries to direct traffic destined for the other VPC to the peering connection.

6. **VPN Connections:**
   - If you have a VPN connection to your on-premises network, you need a route table that directs the relevant traffic to the Virtual Private Gateway (VGW) or Transit Gateway.

7. **Transit Gateway:**
   - When using a Transit Gateway to connect multiple VPCs and on-premises networks, each VPC requires route tables to direct traffic to the Transit Gateway.

8. **Direct Connect:**
   - For direct connections between your on-premises data center and AWS, route tables need to include routes directing traffic to the Direct Connect Gateway or Virtual Private Gateway.

9. **Inter-Region VPC Peering:**
   - For traffic between VPCs in different AWS regions, route tables must include routes to the appropriate peering connection.

### Key Components of a Route Table

- **Routes:**
  - Each route in a route table specifies a destination (CIDR block) and a target (e.g., IGW, NAT Gateway, peering connection, VGW, Transit Gateway).

- **Associations:**
  - Route tables are associated with one or more subnets within a VPC. A subnet can be associated with only one route table at a time.

- **Propagation:**
  - In the context of VPN and Direct Connect, route propagation allows routes from a Virtual Private Gateway or Transit Gateway to be automatically propagated to a route table.

### Examples

1. **Public Subnet Route Table:**
   ```
   Destination        Target
   10.0.0.0/16        Local (implicit for VPC internal traffic)
   0.0.0.0/0          Internet Gateway (igw-xxxxxxx)
   ```

2. **Private Subnet Route Table with NAT Gateway:**
   ```
   Destination        Target
   10.0.0.0/16        Local (implicit for VPC internal traffic)
   0.0.0.0/0          NAT Gateway (nat-xxxxxxx)
   ```

3. **Route Table for VPC Peering:**
   ```
   Destination        Target
   10.0.0.0/16        Local (implicit for VPC internal traffic)
   192.168.0.0/16     VPC Peering Connection (pcx-xxxxxxx)
   ```

### When Not to Use

While route tables are essential for most routing configurations, they are not directly used in scenarios involving:
- Simple single-subnet VPCs using default settings without special routing needs.
- Purely managed services like AWS Lambda, where networking is abstracted away from the user.

By understanding when and how to use route tables in AWS, you can effectively manage network traffic within your VPC, ensuring proper routing, security, and connectivity to other networks and the internet.

3. I created an ec2 within a public subnet & added internet gateway route to the route table but without enabling assign IP in ec2 config? can I call this ec2 publicly ? if yes what will e the url?

If you created an EC2 instance within a public subnet, added an Internet Gateway route to the route table, but did not enable the "Auto-assign Public IP" option for the instance, then the EC2 instance will not have a public IP address. Without a public IP address, you cannot directly access the instance from the internet.

### Why Can't You Access It?

- **No Public IP**: The EC2 instance does not have a public IP address assigned to it, so it is not reachable from the internet. The Internet Gateway and the route table setup enable public access, but without a public IP, there's no address for the instance to be reached at from outside the VPC.

### Solution

To make the EC2 instance accessible publicly, you need to assign a public IP address to it. You can do this either by enabling the "Auto-assign Public IP" option when launching the instance or by associating an Elastic IP address with the instance.

### Steps to Assign an Elastic IP Address

1. **Allocate an Elastic IP**:
   - Go to the **EC2 Dashboard** in the AWS Management Console.
   - In the left-hand menu, under **Network & Security**, click on **Elastic IPs**.
   - Click **Allocate Elastic IP address** and then **Allocate**.

2. **Associate the Elastic IP with the EC2 Instance**:
   - In the **Elastic IPs** section, select the Elastic IP address you just allocated.
   - Click **Actions** and then **Associate Elastic IP address**.
   - Select the instance and the private IP address of your EC2 instance from the dropdown lists.
   - Click **Associate**.

### Accessing the EC2 Instance Publicly

Once the Elastic IP address is associated with the EC2 instance, you can access the instance using the Elastic IP address.

- **URL to Access**: If your Elastic IP address is `203.0.113.25`, you can access the instance by:
  - **SSH**: `ssh -i /path/to/your-key.pem ec2-user@203.0.113.25`
  - **HTTP/HTTPS**: If you have a web server running on the instance, you can access it using `http://203.0.113.25` or `https://203.0.113.25` depending on your setup.

Remember to ensure that your instance’s security group allows the necessary inbound traffic (e.g., port 22 for SSH, port 80 for HTTP, port 443 for HTTPS).

### Security Group Configuration

- **SSH Access**: Allow inbound traffic on port 22 from your IP address or a specific range.
- **HTTP Access**: Allow inbound traffic on port 80 from anywhere (0.0.0.0/0).
- **HTTPS Access**: Allow inbound traffic on port 443 from anywhere (0.0.0.0/0). 

By following these steps, you can make your EC2 instance publicly accessible using the Elastic IP address.
